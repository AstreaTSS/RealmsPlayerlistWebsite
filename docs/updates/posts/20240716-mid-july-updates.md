# Update Post - Mid July Updates

Hello! There's only one new feature this time around, but it's a fun one. Take a look!

<!-- more -->

## Miscellaneous Statistics

There's now a new command - `/misc-stats`! This command is a collection of various statistics and tools that don't fit anywhere else.

For example, you can get the average playtime of all players on the Realm:

<figure markdown>
  ![Picture on how /misc-stats average-playtime looks like.](average_playtime.png){ loading="lazy"}
</figure>

As of right now, there is:
- `/misc-stats average-playtime` - the average playtime of all players or a specified player on the Realm.
- `/misc-stats total-playtime` - the total playtime of all players or a specified player on the Realm.

More may be added in the future, so keep an eye out for that!
