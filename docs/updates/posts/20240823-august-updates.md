# Update Post - August 2024 Updates

Hello! It's been a crazy month with the Realms outage, huh? Well, here's what's new!

<!-- more -->

## Realms Outage

As you may have noticed, Realms went down for around 7 days. The new update for Minecraft seems to be the cause, though we may never know the actual cause - regardless, it caused this bot to be down for a while.

The bot is back up now, though! Relaying what I said on the [support server](https://discord.gg/NSdetwGjpK):

- Voting restrictions will be disabled until (around) August 28, 2024 19:17 (7:17 PM) UTC.
- Premium users can ask for a reimbursement for this month by joining the support server, going to #pl-premium-chat, and reading the pinned message.
- Currently, a giveaway is happening for 2 Playerlist Premium codes for one month, also currently happening in the support server.

## New Features

### Find Longest Session

A new command has been added - `/misc-stats longest-session`! This command allows you to find the longest session a player has had on the Realm, or the longest session on the Realm (for a specified time period for both cases). This command is available to all users, though it requires either voting or purchasing Premium to use if ran for the whole Realm.

!!! note
    Of course, voting restrictions are currently disabled, so you can use this command without voting or purchasing Premium until August 28, 2024 19:17 (7:17 PM) UTC.

### New Frequency For Reoccuring Leaderboard

For [Playerlist Premium](premium.md) users, a new frequency has been added for the reoccuring leaderboard - every 24 hours! This means that you can now have a leaderboard that gets sent every day, instead of every week or every month.
