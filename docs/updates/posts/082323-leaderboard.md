# Playtime Leaderboard

Introducing `/leaderboard`! This command allows you to view a ranked list of players by playtime for your Realm. This command is available to all users, though it requires either voting or purchasing Premium to use.

You can see an example of it below:

This command allows you to select a variety of periods to use for how far back you want to go - this currently includes 24 hours (a day), 1 week, 2 weeks, and 30 days (roughly a month). Playtime is showed down to the minute, though the rounding may lead to slightly off results.

The leaderboard allows you to scroll through it while it is active to see every player, though it automatically disables scrolling through it after 2 minutes.

# Privacy Policy Update

Unrelated to the above, but gamertags are no longer stored for 14 days before being re-fetched - they now only last for 7 days to allow gamertags to update faster if someone changes their name. The [Privacy Policy](privacy_policy.md) has been updated to reflect this and also to fix a spelling mistake.
