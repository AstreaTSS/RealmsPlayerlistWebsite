# Update Post - Mid June 2024

Hello! There isn't as much this time around, but there's still things to announce. Take a look!

<!-- more -->

## Everything from Early June is Now Live on the Main Bot

All of the features from the [Early June update](060624-early-june-updates.md) are now live on the main bot. This includes:
- Nicknames! You can now set nicknames for players, and they'll be used in most commands.
- Merging the link Realm commands. There's now only one command to link a Realm, and it'll ask you which method you want to use.
- The new security check for linking Realms via Realm code/link. This check will make sure you're an operator/owner of the Realm before linking it.

### Other Unannounced Changes From Zero

- `/config playerlist-channel` has been renamed to `/config autorunning-playerlist-channel`.
- `/xuid-from-gamertag` now exists! It's mostly just a useful debug command though.
- New splash texts/statuses have been added to the bot. Not too many, though.

## Speaking of Zero...

Unforunately, people didn't seem to use Playerlist Zero as much as I hoped. As such, I've shut the bot down. RIP, you didn't last long.

## New Colors!

Final announcement - the bot's primary color has shifted! To be more exact, it went from #b05bff to #c156e0. In essence, the color went from a solid purple to a more pinkish-purple (or purplish-pink) - check it out below!
