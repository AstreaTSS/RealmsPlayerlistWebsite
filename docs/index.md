<p align="center">
  A bot that helps out owners of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms by showing various statistics related to player join/leaves.
</p>

It's:
- ðŸš€ **Fast:** Under the right (and typical) circumstances, it can generate a list of ~300 players in under *4 seconds,* 3-3.5 of which is only due to Discord's rate limits.
- ðŸ“Š **Informative:** The main feature of the bot, the playerlist, can give a detailed log of players on a Realm at a moment's notice. You can also get a breakdown for an individual player to analyze as you wish.
- ðŸ‘Œ **Easy to Use**: Simply add the bot, link your Realm, and you already have join/leave tracking enabled. Take a look at the [Server Setup Guide](wiki/server_setup) for more information.
- ðŸ”“ **Open Source**: The code is available to the public and able to be audited and learned from. Dedicated users can even (try to) self-host the bot, if they wish.

# Features

## The Playerlist
Of course, this is the main feature of the bot. It's also one of those features that is easier to show than tell:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/462286782080483350/1070057811461030000/P1Ioje6.png" alt="Picture of how the playerlist looks like." width=550/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <i>The censored space are gamertags of users on the Realm.</i>
</p>

The command version allows you to get who was on the Realm up to the last 24 hours. There is also an automatic version that runs every hour in a specified channel (as seen in the picture) - it displays a list going back an hour, every hour.

The command can normally only be run by people with Manage Server permissions (can be adjusted the same way you adjust other slash command permissions) and is not meant to be seen by normal people. However, for normal users, there *is* a command that can be run by everyone that allows you to view everyone currently online: `/online`.

## Specific Player Information

You can also request for a breakdown of join/leaves (otherwise known as sessions) via `/get-player-log`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775915758588657664/1070080734674563213/xKSymiK.png" alt="Picture of how /get-player-log looks like." width=550/>
</p>

Using this command allows you to scroll through each session in an intuitive format. For fun, the command also displays their total playtime.

By default, the command only goes back a day, but it can go till 7, as seen here.

## Realm Down Notifications

Realms go down a lot if they're big, most likely because they can't handle the load. Sometimes, it can be useful to get pinged when that happens:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775915758588657664/1070089064725893180/zlqU7X8.png" alt="Picture of how the Realm down notifications looks like."/>
</p>

This simply hooks onto your autorunning playerlist. The Realm offline detection is mostly accurate - it may not work as well for smaller Realms, but for larger ones, it should work fine.

## Graphs

You can make cool graphs about your Realm and its users:

<p align="center">

</p>

There are a variety of options to chose from, from the graph up above to a day-to-day breakdown. The data isn't 100% accurate, but you can use it to observe patterns... or just show it off for fun.

Free users have limited options that do not go back as far. Premium users can go all the way back to 30 days.

## Premium

**Realms Playerlist Premium** allows for extra features that otherwise could not be provided by the bot without funding. While this is very basic for now, it is planned to expand heavily in the future.

Take a closer look at Premium [here.](wiki/premium)

### Live Playerlist

Instead of making the bot send a summary of people on every hour, a **live playerlist** shows who joined and left a Realm every minute, basically making it a live join/leave logger.

It looks something like this (minus the obvious censoring):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25420078/194965554-7e0b15a4-2186-4797-bd1d-9645c1caee79.png" alt="Preview on how the live playerlist looks like." height=420/>
</p>

This has a variety of uses, from statistical to moderation - it's really up to you what you do with this information. I know of one Realm owner who uses it both to narrow down subjects to a precise degree while also tracking active Realm times. Using Discord's search functionality (heavily suggest looking into that if you haven't use it, by the way), the possibilities are near endless.

### More Options For Graphs

Free users have a limited period of how far they can go back in terms of the data graphed, and have limited options on how it can be graphs. With Premium, users can go back 30 days and graph in a variety of ways.

# Adding The Bot
